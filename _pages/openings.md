# Open positions

If you are interested in our [research](research), please contact [Dr. Rebekka Burkholz](https://sites.google.com/view/rebekkaburkholz/). For further information about pursuing a PhD position at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, see the [CISPA Career portal](https://career.cispa.de/phd.html).

### Past open positions

We received an ERC Starting Grant in 2023 ([SPARSE-ML](https://cispa.de/en/erc-burkholz)) and had several open positions for PhD students and Postdocs:

- [PhD position in sparse machine learning](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/144401) (2023).
- [Postdoctoral position in sparse machine learning](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/144392) (2023).

Other previously open positions:

- [PhD position in machine learning](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/871979) (2022).

### Possible research topics

We are particularly interested in candidates with affinity towards theory. We require an enthusiasm for research and curiosity for the inner workings of complex models.

- Deep learning (theory and applications)
- Sparse learning and modelling (e.g. lottery tickets)
- Graph neural networks (GNNs)
- Complex networks
- Discrete probabilistic models
- Robust learning algorithms
- Meaningful applications:
  - Molecular biology and genetics (in collaboration with domain experts at Harvard)
  - International food trade
  - etc.
